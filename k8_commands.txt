Kubernetes Commands Reference
Cluster & Nodes
kubectl get nodes                 # List all nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide         # List nodes with detailed info
kubectl describe node <node-name> # Detailed node info

Pods
kubectl get pods                  # List all pods
kubectl get pods -o wide          # Detailed pod info
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>   # Details of a specific pod
kubectl logs <pod-name>           # View logs of a pod
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash  # Enter pod shell
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>     # Delete a pod

Deployments
kubectl create deployment <name> --image=<image> --replicas=<n>  # Create deployment
kubectl get deployments                                        # List deployments
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>                  # Detailed deployment info
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<n>      # Scale deployment
kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> <container>=<image>  # Update image
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>                    # Delete deployment

Services
kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --type=NodePort --port=<port>  # Expose deployment
kubectl get services               # List all services
kubectl describe service <service-name>  # Details of a service
kubectl delete service <service-name>    # Delete a service

Port Forwarding
kubectl port-forward deployment/<deployment-name> <local-port>:<pod-port>
# Example: kubectl port-forward deployment/my-first-deployment 8080:80

Watch Resources
kubectl get pods -w            # Watch pods continuously
kubectl get deployments -w     # Watch deployments continuously
kubectl get services -w        # Watch services continuously

Debugging
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>      # Debug pod issues
kubectl logs <pod-name>              # View container logs
kubectl get events                   # View recent cluster events
kubectl get all                      # List all resources in current namespace


✅ These commands cover pods, deployments, services, scaling, debugging, and port-forwarding — everything you need for hands-on Kubernetes practice.
